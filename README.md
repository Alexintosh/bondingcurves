This is an exploration of the different automated market making algorithms in DeFi.

## Setup

We recommend you use pyenv to manage your python versions.

We have used python 3.9.1 in this repo.

On how to use pyenv, look [here](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/).

We also advise you use venv module to manage the per project Python dependencies.

For example, once you have installed the 3.9.1 python version with pyenv, execute this

`$python -m venv ~/.v/uclamm`

Ensure that python points to the newly installed Python. This command will create a uclamm python virutal environment. Now you are ready to install the dependencies required for this project.

Activate the environment

`$source ~/.v/uclamm/bin/activate`

Simply execute

`$pip install -r requirements.txt` in this workspace

## Usage

You are now ready to use this repo. Simply run

`$chmod +x main.py && ./main.py`
